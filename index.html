											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate working with Prof. Decker French at UIUC.  I study Changing-Look AGN (CL-AGN), a type of AGN which changes Seyfert types on month-to-year timescales.  I use CL-AGN host galaxies to test theories for how CL-AGN occur.</p>

									<h2>Outreach and Service</h2>
									<h3>Astrobites</h3>
									<p>I am an Astrobites contributor as of Spring 2025 and was an Astrobites media intern for AAS 246. <a href="https://astrobites.org/author/mverrico/">Here's a link to my author page!</a></p>

									<h3>Public talks</h3>
									<p>I love giving public lectures at the University of Illinois observatory and at elementary schools around Urbana-Champaign. Recently, I gave a remote talk at the Marz-Kohl Observatory in Western New York (where I'm from!). <a href="https://martzobservatory.org/maggie-verrico-2025/">That talk is recorded here.</a></p>
									
									<h3>Summer Camp</h3>
									<p>I ran the UIUC High School Girls' Astronomy Summer Camp in June 2023 and July 2024.  We work with local high schoolers on a variety of astronomy-related projects, including night observing, spectroscopy, and a coding exercise.  For 2024, we have expanded the summer camp to a full week, developed a week-long coding project to introduce students to Python programming, and recruited nearly double the campers we had in 2023. <a href="https://gasc.cosmology.illinois.edu/">The summer camp website can be found here.</a></p>

									<h3>Science Olympiad</h3>
									Since 2023, I have run the state Solar System B events for Illinois Science Olympiad.  I also wrote the exam for the regional-level competition at Parkland College in 2023 and 2024.  

									<h3>Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program</h3>
									Since 2023, I have been a research student mentor for Tanay Agrawal, a UIUC undergraduate with whom I was paired through UIUC's Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP).  URAP pairs undergraduates with no prior research experience with graduate student research mentors.  I received mentorship training and a Graduate College Mentoring Certificate through the program.  My mentee learned the Python programming language and gained a background in galaxy evolution and AGN studies.  
									
									<h3>Society for Equity in Astronomy</h3>
									In academic year 2023-2024, I was co-chair of SEA, the Society for Equity in Astronomy at UIUC.  SEA provides several services to undergraduates and grad students at UIUC, including a mentor-mentee program, information on research funding and opportunities, study breaks, and our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Tea with visiting colloquium speakers.  In 2024, in addition to our usual programming, we hosted panels on applying to graduate schools and summer research opportunities for our undergraduates.  <a href="https://sea.astro.illinois.edu/">You can learn more about SEA at our website.</a>

									I have also participated in the SEA undergraduate mentoring program since the fall of 2022.  I currently mentor two undergraduate students in the astronomy program at UIUC.  This program aims to guide underrepresented students in astronomy through their degrees and into successful careers.
